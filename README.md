Infinite Einsten Tiles2 is a game made in unity. Clone the repository and import it into unity; there are many detailed instructions on the web on how to run this in unity, so I won't go into them here.

If you are unable to do so, please consider purchasing on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3893930/Infinite_Einstein_Tiles2/).
